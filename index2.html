      <p>Hello! My name is Julian Villalba, I am 26 years old, and I’m a Web Developer, Designer, and I’m an expert in Data Entry. Ever since I was young I had a knack for computers, I even took Web Design 1, 2, and 3 in Highschool and have developed my skills over time. I am a jack of all trades having many different talents and can be a great asset in many positions! I work well both in teams and by myself and I’m actively trying to learn more and more in whatever subject I seem to find myself involved in at that point. I tend to enjoy the front end of development more so than the back end, however, I have no problem doing either!</p>

        <p>I have fluency in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, Node, SQL, Mongo DB, React, and Python.</p>
        
       <p>
        I know my way around Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and Dreamweaver very well! As well as the entire Microsoft Office series, even earning a certification in Microsoft Office fluency from Microsoft themselves. I learned my Data Entry skills from working as a Pharmacy Technician for 4 years. In the process I’ve gathered the ability to successfully type 130WPM(words per minute) with high accuracy.
        Since my departure from Havana LTC Pharmacy, I found myself doing freelance work, odd jobs, making money through a paintball related business, and working part time for Orbital Paintball. Paintball being a hobby/sport I am very passionate about, even playing competitively from time to time.
      </p>
